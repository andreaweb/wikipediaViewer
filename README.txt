WIKIPEDIA VIEWER - FREE CODE CAMP

Project built as part of Free Code Camp's curriculum. Used HTML, CSS and JS (Jquery).

This is a wikipedia search. As you type something in the input, a list shows up below with articles which title resembles what you wrote.

It uses the Wikipedia API. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search_and_discovery

A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
